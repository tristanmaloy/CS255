Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is Liam, the owner of DriverPass. Liam wants to make a new system that promotes and provides better driver training. This system provides online classes, practice tests, as well as on the road training. There are three seperate packages DriverPass wants to provide. The system will be cloud based but accessible offline. All data will be uploaded to a server to allow the company to study trends and growth of the business. 

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did well with colleting requirements. This aspect of the SDLC requires close attention to detail as well as thinking outside the box to allow a unique and diverse program to be built.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would continue to revise requirements as needed. There is always room for improvement and I am sure there are requirements that were not mentioned. If I was able to actually communicate with the client myself, I would be able to specify better. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Ultimately, the job is to create the system that the client wants made. It is essential to listen and try to provide the system they want for both client and customer satisfaction. The client knows the customer better than the programmers, the programmers should be focused on creating the best iteration of the program for the client/customer. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
It is always a good idea to have a frame of reference when designing software. There should be a lot of examples and requirements to base the project on. I would look at what other similar projects offer as far as requirements and see how they can be molded into the clients version of course upon the clients approval.
